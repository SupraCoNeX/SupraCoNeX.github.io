BISDN is currently one of 3 companies working closely with Deutsche Telekom in
the TEAC incubator program of the Telecom Infrastructure Project (TIP). Further
cooperations exist with Intel and HPE. As a result, prototypes for e.g.
BRAS/BNG, IPSec gateways, or WiFi cloud solutions have been developed in the
last years, which show the potential of software-based solutions, if their
functionality is suitably supported by external ASICs or FPGAs. Since last
year, these prototypes have been successively transferred into products. BISDN
was and is active in a number of national (SENDATE, SESAM) and EU projects
(FP7 UNIFY, H2020 5GEx).
