bio: "The Department of Information Theory and Communication Systems, headed by Prof. Eduard A. Jorswieck, conducts research and development in the areas of applied information theory, signal processing for communication networks, and optimal design of communication systems. Application areas include multiple antennas and multicell multiple subscriber systems in IEEE 802.11 and 4G-/5G-and subsequent cellular networks."

Prof. Jorswieck was and is involved in several national and international
collaborative research projects or leads them in the function of consortium
leader: subproject leader in the BMBF projects Cool Silicon (Cool Cellular),
FAST (Fast Secure and Fast Cloud), PROPHYLAXE and in the BMWI EXIST research
transfer project Enhanced Radio Resource Trading. He led the EU FP7 project
SAPHYRE as technical project leader and was/is project partner in
FP7 NoE ACROPOLIS, DIWINE, and H2020 ITN 5G Wireless.
Prof. Eduard Jorswieck has been a university professor and head of the
Department of Information Theory and Communication Systems in the Institute of
Communications Engineering at the Technische Universität Braunschweig (TUBr)
since 2019. Prior to that, he was a university professor for eleven years and
headed the Chair of Theoretical Communications Engineering at TU Dresden.
Eduard's research interests are in applied information theory, signal
processing, and communication theory. In these areas, he has authored more than
115 journal publications, 3 monographs, 13 book chapters, and just over 275
conference papers, as well as presented over 10 tutorials at IEEE conferences.
Most recently at IEEE Globecom in December 2018 on "Signal Processing Techniques
for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC)", where new algorithms for
scheduling and resource allocation were presented using adaptive Markov models
and reinforcement learning. Since 2017, he has been Editor-in-Chief of the
Springer EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking. He is an
IEEE Senior Member (IEEE Fellow as of 2020) and an elected member of the
IEEE SAM Technical Committee.

A systematic approach to modeling and solving distributed resource allocation
problems in interference networks are so-called multi-armed bandits.
In mathematics and especially in operations research, such models for
single-user systems (local optimization at a network node) are very well known.
In the SupraCoNeX project, however, these models have to be extended to multiple
participants/nodes. This requires a sound knowledge of the theory of multi-armed
bandits, because the use goes beyond a pure application. There are few experts
in this research area worldwide and no partner in the project consortium has the
sufficient qualifications. The local closest proven expert on MABs is Professor
Peter Auer from Leoben. In order for the project to consider this essential
point of modeling and system optimization, the subcontract to the
Montanuiversität Leoben is indispensable.
