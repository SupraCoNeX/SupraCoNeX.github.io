NMN is actively involved in the development of the open source Linux mac802.11
subsystem with it's employee Felix Fietkau , who is the maintainer of the
de-facto standard WLAN rate control algorithm "Minstrel_HT" in the Linux
kernel, which is the basis of today's WLAN routers, as well as the open
source WLAN driver "mt76" for chipsets of the MT76xx series from Mediatek.

Furthermore, NMN is involved in the development of the WLAN driver ath9k,
which was created in intensive cooperation with Atheros (today Qualcomm Atheros).
In addition to system and driver development, solutions for client management
via multiple access points as well as solutions for remote management, among
others for Nokia-Siemens, are also developed.
