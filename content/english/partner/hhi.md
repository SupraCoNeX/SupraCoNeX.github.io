### About Me

The department's research focuses on dynamic resource allocation in wireless
communication networks [SST09], programmatic control and virtualization of
wireless networks (Software-Defined Wireless Networking) [JSZ15, JSZ16, JSZ17],
the combination of machine learning and communication, in particular the
development of information extraction mechanisms and, based on them, predictive
analysis tools to support (distributed) decision-making processes in the
network, and anomaly detection. Furthermore, the department has profound
expertise in network-assisted D2D communication, channel and interference
estimation, coexistence and interference management, and cognitive network
management (consensus building, detection, classification, and prediction).

For this research project, Fraunhofer HHI can build on preliminary work on the
following key areas: (1) The development of robust and efficient algorithms and
protocols for wireless networks (HyEff, 3GET, ScaleNet, MxMo-bile, Smart-RF,
EASY-C, IntelliSpektrum, ComGreen, FANTASTIC5G, mmMAGIC, CoMoRa, One5G) as well
as coordinated, robust and secure real-time communications in industry and
commerce (IC4F, KOI, SEKOM). (2) The development and application of machine
learning methods for communication networks. A major research focus is the
development of novel information extraction mechanisms and predictive analysis
tools (e.g. EU projects GreenNets, BMBF project SEKOM, BMWi project IC4F as well
as in the context of direct industry collaborations). The focus is especially on
the development of "online" methods with low complexity, e.g. to process
measurements in active networks in real time.

The HHI has a powerful high-performance computing cluster (250 computing nodes
with 300 TFLOPs peak performance, 1.64 PB of decentralized as well as 250 TB of
centralized storage and up to 100 Gigabit Ethernet connections), which is
capable of handling computationally intensive machine learning problems or
extremely large data sets. The evaluation and performance analysis of the AI
algorithms and SND orchestration will take place in the productive broadband
network of Evernet eG and will be awarded to Evernet eG as part of an R&D
subcontract. This R&D contract is coordinated by the HHI.
