### About Me

Current research topics include analysis of the performance of computer network
systems, in particular analysis of bottlenecks in the Internet and ways of
resolving them, heterogeneous and programmable networking, cloud networks, and
network optimization. Furthermore, the INET department conducts research on
wide-area data analytics, systems for countering targeted attacks on high-speed
networks, techniques for providing guarantees in TCP/IP networks, basic protocol
security (security and privacy by design), intrusion detection systems, and
dynamic placement of network functions (NFV). Prof. Anja Feldmann is a member of
the Leopoldina - National Academy of Sciences, the Academia Europaea, and the
Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences. In 2011, she received the Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the DFG.
