The research focus of the Department of Communications Engineering, headed by
Prof. Dr.-Ing. Thomas Hühn since October 2019, is on practical resource
allocation of transmit power and transmit rates in wireless WLAN networks.
Prof. Hühn has a PhD on efficient algorithms for resource allocation in
application-oriented WLAN-based wireless networks and has acquired and led
several national and international research projects. As an active partner in
national (Verdele FACTS - BMWI) and European (MONROE - Horizon2020) research
projects, Prof. Hühn has acquired a deep technical knowledge of network
experiments for validation and performance evaluation of resource allocation
algorithms and wireless software-defined networks concepts in WLAN-based radio
networks. The Internet Automation-Electrical Engineering course is
significantly influenced by Prof. Hühn's courses on communication engineering
and will experience a new, practical use case for performance enhancement in
wireless networks through the collaborative research project SupraCoNex.
The consortium leadership of the joint research project SupraCoNex is
coordinated by Prof. Hühn and his colleagues. The many years of expertise that
Prof. Hühn brings to the Department of Communication Technology at Nordhausen
University of Applied Sciences with regard to the coordination and management
of collaborative research projects ensures the success of the project in terms
of scientific, entrepreneurial and educational cooperation between the project
partners.
