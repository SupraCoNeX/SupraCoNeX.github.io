## ABOUT OUR JOURNY

The SupraCoNeX research project enables application-specific, AI-based resource
allocation and efficient management of today's wireless 802.11-based (WLAN)
networks in home, enterprise and provider contexts. In particular, statistical
and adversarial multi-armed-bandit algorithms will be developed for diverse
application areas in wireless networks with specific communication quality
requirements in terms of throughput, latency, security, and robustness, and
evaluated in production communication networks with real Internet traffic.
