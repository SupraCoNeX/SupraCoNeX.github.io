## Running the setup locally

You can either install hugo locally on your machine or clone the docker image

```
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/ikstream/hugo-docker/hugo:latest
```

## Creating new posts

To add one image to the top of all posts of a topic just place a hero.svg in
the root of this topic.

For an individual image for a post create a directory in that topic for that
post and place a hero.svg there, as well as the posts markdown file
